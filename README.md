## EXP-1: Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Aim
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Experiment
Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:
* Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
* Focus on Generative AI architectures, specifically the Transformer model.
* Discuss key Generative AI applications.
* Analyze the impact of scaling on LLMs.

### Algorithm
1.  **Understand the Core Request**: The user wants a comprehensive report following a specific template. The report must cover four key areas related to Generative AI and LLMs.
